# Enhancement Two: Databases
The Artifact I selected was from one of my previous classes. CS 340 (Advanced Programming Concepts). It was originally written in Python. So, what I did was to use the concept from the project to recreate a new project using JavaScript and MongoDB where I was interacting with the Database from the console. 

This project really shows my skill in what I can accomplish as a developer. I implemented all the CRUD operation for interacting with the Database. It was a little bit challenging at first when I started the project, but I was a able to learn so much before I completed the Database artifact enhancement. I used the Polka HTTP Server which was handling the HTTP requests.
