# Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design
The artifact I selected was from one of my previous classes. IT-145 (Foundation in Application Development). It is a java file that was created around September 2019. This is almost two years now. I have learned a lot of things from that period till now. That’s one of the reasons I selected it. I include this artifact in my ePortfolio because it shows I am familiar with the Java programming language, one of the most widely used object-oriented programming languages. This also confirms I am well familiarized with the object-oriented software design pattern. The artifact was improved by renaming some of the variables that weren’t clear enough, like ‘tVar’ to ‘newPassengerName.’ 

I also added more commits to the code to understand anyone who comes across the file will understand what exactly is going on. Based on the feedback I have been getting from my instructor and the rubrics guide, I firmly believe I have met the course objectives which I planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One. Regarding security, I was able to identify and rectify some bugs in the code.

Reflecting on the process of enhancing/modifying my artifact. I learned a lot because I was able to see things from a better perspective on the process of good software design and engineering.
