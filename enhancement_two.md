# Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures
The artifact I selected was from one of my previous classes. IT-145 (Foundation in Application Development). It is a java file that was created around September 2019. This is almost two years now. I have learned a lot of things from that period till now. That’s one of the reasons I selected it. I include this artifact in my ePortfolio because it shows I am familiar with the Java programming language, one of the most widely used object-oriented programming languages. I was able to improve the efficiency of the code by reducing the multiple “for” loops. This will make the code execute faster. 

I also expanded the complexity of the code by adding a new function after the “printPassenger” function. The new function is “welcomePassenger”
