### Journey So Far
This has been an incredible journey for me since when I started back in 2018. I have learnt a number of things which has really helped me in my day to
day life as a human and also as a software engineer. I was able to relate all that is been taught in class to all that is been carried out in today's industry. Having a computer science degree has been one of my goal which I kept on pushing with the help and feedback of my instructors. I am excited to be completing the last weeks of finally getting my degree. 

The course has given me a chance to collaborate in a team environment like I remember one of the courses where we were learning about git and all the class members had to review the pull requests of other members. That was really fun and showed how collaboration can help a team to grow.

I also learnt about proper communication to stakeholders, either during a presentation which is to be reviewed by the instructor or other team members or during the number of discussion and responses where we give our feedback based on what has been written or said. 

One of my most exciting times during this journey is my data structures and algorithm class. I was always looking forward to the class before it even started. I fully understand this was one of the basic and core fundamentals of computer science as the topic is also broad. ThThe journey was really an eye opener for me personally. 

Software engineering and database was quite fun as I was also able to use this class to refine my past projects and get feedback from my instructor on the corrections that need to be made. I have totally grasped all the core fundamental of the important topic. This is part of enhancement I did.

I also was able to learnt a lot about security and secure coding. One of my best moment is when I learnt a lot about best practices when it comes to creating softwares and applications. 

### Education Reflection
I number of courses that were quite challenging. This prompted me to do further research into getting a clearer understanding of the subject topic.
I also was able to incorporate the feedbacks from my instructors who were really knowledgeable and responded fat to my questions and concerns. 
There were some few courses I really loved and I had some other few once where I was finally excited to be completing the course. My overall goal
was to finish each course with the highest grades possible. I was able to achieve this in a number of courses.

The courses have further strengthened my knowledged about computer science concepts and fundamentals which I can further expand on as the field and information and innovation keeps on expanding and new concepts are always created. That is one of the things that drew me to the field, cause of the fact
that their is continuous learning and development.

### Portfolio Summary
My portfolio comprise of three different artifacts which showcase my skills as a software engineer and a prospective full stack developer. The Software Engineering and Design, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases. Each of them showcase all my different unique skills. The first enhancement shows my skills and knowledge in Object oriented programming and optimization of the java code as well as including more comments so it can be easily understood by another person that wants to continue working on the project. This was more geared towards software design and engineering. 

The second enhancement was geared towards algorithms and data structures which was more about enhancing and optimizing the same code for better performance. The third enhancement was more geared towards showcasing by Database skills. I was able to rewrite the code in another language which was javascript and I made use of MongoDB. These were all interesting projects.
